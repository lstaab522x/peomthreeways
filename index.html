            The poet sits and dreams and dreams; <br>
            He scans his verse; he probes his themes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Then turns to stretch or stir about, <br>
            Lest, like his thoughts, his strength give out. 
        </p>

    <div class="g2">
        <p>
            Then off to bed, for he must rise <br>
            And cord some wood, or tamp some ties, 
        </p>

        <p>
            Or break a field of fertile soil, <br>
            Or do some other manual toil. 
        </p>

    <div class="g3">
        <p>
            He dare not live by wage of pen, <br>
            Most poorly paid of poor paid men, 
        </p>
        <p>
            With shoes o’er-run, and threadbare clothes,— <br>
            And editors among the foes
        </p>

        <p>
            Who mock his song, deny him bread, <br>
            Then sing his praise when he is dead.
